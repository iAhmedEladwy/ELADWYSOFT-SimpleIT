Fix Employees Import - Missing English Name Required Field
Problem
Employees import is failing because English Name field is required but missing or empty. All employee records are failing validation.
Root Cause
The English Name field is marked as required in the database but is not being mapped or populated during import.
Solution: Handle English Name Field in Employees Import
1. Add English Name to Field Mapping Interface

Include "English Name" in employees import field mapping
Mark as required field with red asterisk (*)
Show clear field description: "Employee's English name (required)"
Allow mapping from source file columns like "Name", "Full Name", "Employee Name", "English Name"

2. Handle English Name Data Validation

Check for empty/null values in mapped English Name column
Show validation warning for missing English Name data
Prevent import of records without English Name
Provide data transformation options like combining first/last names if needed

3. Update Employees Import Template

Add "English Name" column to downloadable employees template
Mark as required field in template headers with asterisk (*)
Include example values showing proper English name format
Add instructions explaining this field is mandatory

4. Implement Field Mapping Validation

Show error in mapping interface if English Name is not mapped
Highlight unmapped required field in red
Display field mapping status: "Required fields mapped: X/Y"
Block import completion until English Name is properly mapped

5. Add Data Quality Checks

Validate English Name is not empty string or whitespace only
Check minimum length if required (e.g., at least 2 characters)
Show data preview of English Name values during mapping
Flag problematic records before import execution

6. Update Field Mapping UI for Employees

Show "English Name" prominently in required fields section
Provide smart suggestions for mapping (auto-suggest "Name" column to "English Name")
Display sample data from source column when mapped
Show validation status for each mapped field

7. Test Employees Import Flow

Test with "Name" column mapped to English Name
Test with "English Name" column directly mapped
Test with empty English Name values (should show validation error)
Test with combined name fields (first + last name)
Verify all employees import successfully with valid English Name

This ensures all employee records have a valid English Name before database insertion, eliminating the validation error.
