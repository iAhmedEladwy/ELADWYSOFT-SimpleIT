SimpleIT App: Critical Bug Fixes
Context
My SimpleIT app has several critical bugs that need to be fixed. These issues are affecting core functionality across Assets, Employees, Tickets, and System Config modules. Please fix each bug with proper implementation and testing.

Bug Fix Requirements
1. Assets Module Bugs
Bug 1.1: Asset History - Maintenance Records Status Not Reflected
Issue: When viewing asset history, maintenance records are not showing the correct status or the status is not being updated properly.

Expected Fix:

Ensure maintenance records in asset history display the current status
Verify that when maintenance is performed, the asset status is updated accordingly
Show maintenance history with proper status transitions (e.g., "Available" → "Maintenance" → "Available")
Include timestamps for when status changes occurred
Display maintenance type and description in the history view
Database Check Required:

Verify assetMaintenance table is properly linked to assets table
Ensure maintenance records update the asset status field
Check if maintenance history query includes proper joins
Bug 1.2: Bulk Actions Not Implemented (Sell, Retire, Delete)
Issue: Bulk actions for assets (Sell, Retire, Delete) are missing or not working.

Required Implementation:

Add checkbox selection for multiple assets in the asset grid
Implement "Select All" functionality
Create bulk action buttons: "Bulk Sell", "Bulk Retire", "Bulk Delete"
Bulk Sell: Open modal to enter sale details, update asset status to "Sold"
Bulk Retire: Update selected assets status to "Retired" with confirmation
Bulk Delete: Delete selected assets with proper confirmation dialog
Add progress indicator for bulk operations
Show success/error messages for bulk operations
Update asset counts and refresh grid after bulk operations
Bug 1.3: Row Click Should Open Edit Form
Issue: Clicking on an asset row doesn't open the edit form.

Fix Required:

Make entire asset table row clickable
Clicking any part of the row should open the asset edit modal/form
Ensure row hover effects indicate clickability
Preserve existing column sorting and filtering functionality
Handle edit permissions properly (only allow authorized users to edit)
2. Employees Module Bugs
Bug 2.1: View Assets Feature Not Working
Issue: The "View Assets" functionality for employees is broken or not displaying assigned assets.

Required Fix:

Fix the employee asset view to show all assets assigned to that employee
Display asset details: Asset ID, Type, Brand, Model, Serial Number, Status
Include asset assignment history (when assigned, by whom)
Add proper loading states and error handling
Ensure the view updates when assets are assigned/unassigned
Make assets clickable to view asset details
Database Query Fix:

Verify the join between employees and assets tables using assignedEmployeeId
Include proper error handling for employees with no assigned assets
Show historical assignments, not just current ones
Bug 2.2: Row Click Should Open Edit Form
Issue: Clicking on an employee row doesn't open the edit form.

Fix Required:

Make entire employee table row clickable
Clicking any part of the row should open the employee edit modal/form
Ensure row hover effects indicate clickability
Preserve existing column sorting and filtering functionality
Handle edit permissions properly
3. Tickets Module Bugs
Bug 3.1: Grid Inline Editing - Request Types Not Implemented
Issue: Request types from system config are not available for inline editing in the tickets grid.

Required Fix:

Integrate custom request types from customRequestTypes table in system config
Populate request type dropdown in ticket grid inline editing with:
Default request types: Hardware, Software, Network, Other
Custom request types from system config
Ensure the dropdown shows active request types only (isActive = true)
Update ticket when request type is changed via inline editing
Refresh grid to show updated request type immediately
Implementation Details:

Query customRequestTypes table for active types
Combine with default enum values from ticketRequestTypeEnum
Create proper dropdown component for inline editing
Handle validation and error states
Bug 3.2: Row Click Should Open Edit Form
Issue: Clicking on a ticket row doesn't open the edit form, and rows are not fully clickable.

Fix Required:

Make entire ticket table row clickable (not just specific columns)
Clicking anywhere on the row should open the ticket edit modal/form
Ensure row hover effects indicate clickability
Preserve inline editing functionality for specific fields
Handle edit permissions properly
Show loading state when opening ticket details
4. Assets Management Module Bug
Bug 4.1: Hide Audit Logs from Sidebar
Issue: Audit Logs should not be visible in the Assets Management sidebar navigation.

Fix Required:

Remove "Audit Logs" menu item from Assets Management sidebar
Ensure Audit Logs remain accessible from appropriate admin/system areas
Update navigation permissions if needed
Verify no broken links or navigation issues after removal
5. System Config Module Bug
Bug 5.1: Tickets Request Types - Edit Mode Issues
Issue: When editing ticket request types in system config, clicking on the description field causes the row to exit edit mode unexpectedly.

Required Fix:

Fix the edit mode behavior for request types table
Ensure clicking on description field keeps the row in edit mode
Prevent accidental exit from edit mode when interacting with form fields
Implement proper form validation and error handling
Add save/cancel buttons that are clearly visible and functional
Show proper loading states during save operations
Implementation Details:

Fix event handlers to prevent bubbling that might trigger row deselection
Ensure text areas and input fields maintain focus properly
Add proper form state management
Implement inline validation for required fields
Testing Requirements for Each Fix
After Implementing Fixes, Test:
Assets Module:

Create maintenance record and verify status updates in history
Test bulk sell/retire/delete with multiple assets
Click various parts of asset rows to ensure edit form opens
Verify permissions for different user roles
Employees Module:

Test view assets for employees with and without assigned assets
Click employee rows to verify edit form opens
Test with different user permission levels
Tickets Module:

Test inline editing with both default and custom request types
Verify request types from system config appear in dropdown
Click ticket rows to ensure edit form opens properly
Test inline editing doesn't conflict with row click
Assets Management:

Verify Audit Logs is removed from sidebar
Check all other navigation items still work
Ensure audit logs are accessible from proper admin areas
System Config:

Test editing request type descriptions without exiting edit mode
Verify all form fields work properly in edit mode
Test save/cancel functionality
