Fix Tickets Module UI Issues - Row Click and Inline Editing
Problems Identified
1. Row Click Navigation Issue

Employees and Assets modules: Row click working correctly
Tickets module: Clicking row shows white empty page instead of ticket details
Root Cause: Likely routing issue or missing ticket details component

2. Missing Inline Editing Functionality

Expected: Inline editing for Request Type, Priority, Status, Assigned To fields
Current: Inline editing not working or missing from tickets module
Impact: Users cannot quickly update ticket fields from list view

3. Actions Button Functionality Broken

Problem: Actions dropdown/button generates same white page error
Impact: Users cannot access ticket actions (edit, delete, etc.)

Required Fixes for Tickets Module
1. Fix Row Click Navigation
Investigate and Fix:

Check routing configuration for tickets module
Verify ticket details page/component exists and is properly imported
Check if ticket ID parameter is being passed correctly in URL
Compare with working employees/assets row click implementation
Fix any missing route handlers for ticket details view

Expected Behavior:

Click on any ticket row → Navigate to ticket details page
Display full ticket information including description, history, comments
Show related asset and employee information
Include action buttons for status updates

2. Implement Inline Editing for Key Fields
Add inline editing functionality for:
Request Type Field:

Dropdown selection with available request types (Hardware, Software, Network, Other)
Custom request types if configured in system
Save changes immediately on selection
Show loading state during update

Priority Field:

Dropdown with priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
Color coding for visual distinction
Immediate save on change
Visual feedback for successful update

Status Field:

Status progression dropdown (Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed)
Workflow validation (prevent invalid status transitions)
Automatic timestamp updates for status changes
History logging of status changes

Assigned To Field:

User/agent dropdown with search functionality
Show current assignee with option to change
Handle unassigned tickets (show "Unassigned" option)
Update assignee immediately on selection

3. Fix Actions Button Functionality
Restore actions dropdown with:
View Action:

Navigate to ticket details (same as row click)
Show full ticket information

Edit Action:

Open ticket edit form or modal
Allow editing all ticket fields
Include validation for required fields

Delete Action:

Confirmation dialog before deletion
Soft delete if implemented (archive ticket)
Handle related data (comments, history)

Additional Actions:

Add Comment - quick comment functionality
Print/Export - generate ticket report
Clone Ticket - create similar ticket
Escalate - if escalation workflow exists

4. Fix Component Integration Issues
Check and resolve:

Component imports - ensure all required components are imported
State management - verify ticket data loading and updates
Event handlers - fix any broken click/change handlers
Error boundaries - add error handling to prevent white pages
Loading states - show loading indicators during data operations

5. Ensure Consistency with Other Modules
Match functionality with Employees/Assets:

Same row click behavior across all modules
Consistent inline editing UX where applicable
Similar actions menu structure
Uniform loading and error states
Consistent navigation patterns

Implementation Priorities
Priority 1: Fix Row Click Navigation

Diagnose routing issue causing white page
Restore ticket details view functionality
Test navigation from tickets list to details

Priority 2: Restore Actions Menu

Fix actions button/dropdown functionality
Ensure all actions work without white page errors
Add proper error handling

Priority 3: Implement Inline Editing

Add inline editing for Request Type, Priority, Status, Assigned To
Ensure immediate save functionality
Add visual feedback for successful updates
Include proper validation

Priority 4: Testing and Validation

Test all ticket interactions (row click, inline edit, actions)
Verify data persistence for inline edits
Test error scenarios and edge cases
Ensure consistent UX across all modules

Technical Areas to Check
1. Routing Configuration

Ticket details route definition and parameters
Component mapping for ticket routes
Navigation guards or permissions

2. Component Structure

TicketsList component - row click handlers
TicketDetails component - details view rendering
TicketActions component - actions menu functionality
Inline editing components - dropdown/select components

3. State Management

Ticket data loading and caching
Update operations for inline edits
Error handling for failed operations
Loading states management

4. API Integration

Ticket CRUD endpoints functionality
Bulk update operations for inline edits
Error response handling
Data validation on backend

Success Criteria

✅ Row click navigation works - shows ticket details page
✅ Inline editing works for Request Type, Priority, Status, Assigned To
✅ Actions button/menu functions without errors
✅ All ticket interactions work consistently
✅ Error handling prevents white page errors
✅ Data persistence works for all updates
✅ UX consistency matches other modules (Employees, Assets)

This will restore full functionality to the tickets module and provide the expected user experience for ticket management.
