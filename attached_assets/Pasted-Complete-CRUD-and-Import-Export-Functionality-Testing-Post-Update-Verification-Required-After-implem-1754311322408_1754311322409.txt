Complete CRUD and Import/Export Functionality Testing
Post-Update Verification Required
After implementing the database auto-increment ID generation fixes, comprehensive testing is needed to ensure all core functionality works correctly across all entity types.
CRITICAL TESTING: Employees Module
1. Employee CRUD Operations
Create Employee:

Test manual employee creation through UI form
Verify empId is auto-generated in format EMP-00001, EMP-00002, etc.
Confirm all required fields (English Name, Department, ID Number, Title, etc.) are validated
Test with all employment types (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Intern)
Verify employee status defaults to 'Active'
Check creation timestamp is set properly

Read/View Employees:

Test employee list display shows all employees with generated empId
Verify employee details view displays all fields correctly
Test search and filtering functionality works
Confirm employee hierarchy (direct manager relationships) display correctly

Update Employee:

Test editing employee information (name, department, contact details)
Verify empId cannot be modified (should be read-only or hidden)
Test status changes (Active → Resigned, etc.)
Test employment type updates
Confirm updatedAt timestamp changes on modifications

Delete Employee:

Test employee deletion (soft delete if implemented)
Verify cascading effects on related assets and tickets
Test deletion permissions and confirmation dialogs
Ensure audit trail is maintained for deleted employees

2. Employee Import/Export
Import Testing:

Test CSV import with various employee data formats
Verify field mapping interface excludes empId from mapping options
Test required field validation (English Name, Department, etc.)
Test enum value handling for employment types
Test date field parsing for joining dates
Verify successful import with auto-generated empId values
Test error handling for invalid data (missing required fields, invalid enums)

Export Testing:

Test employee data export to CSV/Excel formats
Verify all employee fields are included in export
Test export filtering (by department, status, etc.)
Confirm export file format is compatible with import

CRITICAL TESTING: Assets Module
1. Asset CRUD Operations
Create Asset:

Test manual asset creation through UI form
Verify assetId is auto-generated in format AST-00001, AST-00002, etc.
Test all required fields (Type, Brand, Serial Number, etc.)
Test asset assignment to employees
Verify asset status defaults to 'Available'
Test purchase date and warranty fields

Read/View Assets:

Test asset list display with generated assetId
Verify asset details view shows all specifications
Test asset search and filtering
Test asset assignment history

Update Asset:

Test asset information updates (specs, status, assignment)
Verify assetId remains unchanged during updates
Test asset status changes (Available → In Use → Maintenance, etc.)
Test employee assignment changes

Delete Asset:

Test asset deletion functionality
Verify related maintenance records handling
Test asset sale/retirement processes

2. Asset Import/Export
Import Testing:

Test asset CSV import with field mapping interface
Verify assetId is excluded from mapping options and marked as "System Generated"
Test asset type and status enum validation
Test asset assignment during import (linking to existing employees)
Verify successful import with proper assetId generation
Test duplicate serial number handling

Export Testing:

Test asset export with all fields included
Test filtered exports (by type, status, assigned employee)
Verify export format compatibility

CRITICAL TESTING: Tickets Module
1. Ticket CRUD Operations
Create Ticket:

Test manual ticket creation through UI form
Verify ticketId is auto-generated in format TKT-00001, TKT-00002, etc.
Test required field validation (Description, Request Type, submitted_by_id)
Test ticket assignment to users/agents
Test asset linking functionality
Verify ticket status defaults to 'Open'

Read/View Tickets:

Test ticket list display with generated ticketId
Test ticket details view with all information
Test ticket search and filtering
Verify ticket history and comments display

Update Ticket:

Test ticket status updates (Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed)
Test ticket assignment changes
Test priority and urgency updates
Verify ticketId remains unchanged

Delete Ticket:

Test ticket deletion (if permitted)
Verify ticket closure processes
Test ticket archiving functionality

2. Ticket Import/Export
Import Testing:

Test ticket CSV import with field mapping
Verify ticketId is excluded from mapping and auto-generated
Test submitted_by_id field mapping and validation (link to existing employees)
Test request type and priority enum validation
Test asset linking during import
Verify successful import with proper ID generation

Export Testing:

Test ticket export with all fields
Test filtered exports (by status, priority, date range)
Verify export includes related employee and asset information

SYSTEM-WIDE INTEGRATION TESTING
1. Cross-Module Relationships

Test employee-asset assignments work correctly after imports
Test ticket-asset relationships are maintained
Test ticket-employee relationships (submitted by, assigned to)
Verify referential integrity across all modules

2. Database Consistency

Verify all auto-generated IDs are unique and sequential
Test concurrent operations don't create duplicate IDs
Confirm database constraints are enforced properly
Test transaction rollbacks work correctly

3. UI/UX Consistency

Verify all forms exclude auto-generated ID fields
Test field mapping interfaces mark auto-generated fields properly
Confirm success messages show generated IDs
Test error handling displays user-friendly messages

PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY TESTING
1. Large Data Sets

Test imports with 1000+ records for each entity type
Verify performance of ID generation at scale
Test memory usage during large imports
Confirm transaction handling for bulk operations

2. Error Recovery

Test import rollback when errors occur mid-process
Verify partial import handling (some records succeed, others fail)
Test duplicate data handling
Confirm data integrity after failed operations

SUCCESS CRITERIA
All Tests Must Pass:

✅ Manual creation of employees, assets, tickets with auto-generated IDs
✅ Full CRUD operations work without ID-related errors
✅ Import functionality works with field mapping and excludes auto-generated IDs
✅ Export functionality includes all relevant data
✅ Cross-module relationships are maintained properly
✅ Database constraints are enforced correctly
✅ UI interfaces are consistent and user-friendly
✅ Error handling provides clear, actionable messages
✅ Performance is acceptable for expected data volumes

IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

Test each module individually - start with employees (known working), then assets, then tickets
Verify ID generation works consistently across all environments
Test import/export flows end-to-end for each entity type
Validate cross-module integrations work properly
Perform stress testing with larger datasets
Document any remaining issues for immediate resolution

This comprehensive testing ensures the entire SimpleIT system functions reliably after the ID generation architecture changes.
